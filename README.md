**e**nd-**o**f-**d**ay a.k.a. **e**xercise-**o**r-**d**ie
An attempt to gamify exercise with **real** game mechanics.

## workflow
I use "pseudo"-agile:
- user stories -> issues
- sprints => milestones
- project backlog -> unmilestoned/unassigned issues
- sprint backlog -> milestoned/unassigned issues
- in progress -> branches working on milestoned/assigned issues
- in review -> PR-ed branches working on milestoned/assigned issues
- closed -> merged branches with closed issues
